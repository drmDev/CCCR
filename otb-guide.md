# Over-the-Board (OTB) Chess Guide <i class="fas fa-chess-board text-primary"></i>

Playing chess in-person (OTB) is a different experience than playing online. Here are some important rules, etiquette tips, and resources to help you prepare for your next rated game.

---

## **Starting the Game** <i class="fas fa-handshake text-success"></i>

- Shake hands with your opponent and wish them good luck before starting.
- The player controlling the black pieces starts the timer after white makes their first move.
  
---

## **Touch Move Rule** <i class="fas fa-hand-pointer text-danger"></i>

- If you touch a piece on the board (yours or your opponent's), you must move it if possible.
- If you touch a piece with the intention of adjusting its position, announce "adjust" (or "jâ€™adoube") first.

---

## **Making a Move and Using the Clock** <i class="fas fa-hourglass text-info"></i>

- On your turn:
  1. Move one of your pieces (and if castling, touch the King before touching the Rook).
  2. Use the **same hand** to press the clock after completing your move.
  3. Write your move in **chess notation** before your opponent moves.

## **Understanding Chess Notation** <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt text-warning"></i>

Chess players are required to record moves during rated games. Learn how to write moves using **algebraic notation** (e.g., `e4`, `Nf3`, `O-O` for castling).

## **Draw Offers and Claiming Draws** <i class="fas fa-handshake-alt text-muted"></i>

- You can offer a draw on your turn, after making a move but **before pressing the clock**.
- You may also claim a draw if:
  - The same position appears on the board three times.
  - Fifty consecutive moves are made without a capture or pawn move.

---

## **Ending the Game** <i class="fas fa-flag-checkered text-success"></i>

- Shake hands with your opponent after the game, regardless of the result.
- Report the game result to the tournament director (win, loss, or draw).

## **Other OTB Tips**

- Arrive on time to avoid losing by forfeit.
- Bring your own **chess clock** and **scorebook** if possible.
- Stay quiet and respectful while games are in progress.
- Avoid touching the chess pieces or clocks of other players during their games.
