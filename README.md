# Community Chess Club of Rochester (CCCR) Website

This site is an unofficial modern revamp of the old Community Chess Club of Rochester website. It aims to present information in a more condensed, up-to-date, and visually appealing way, making it compatible with multiple devices. The old website was stuck in the 90s, and this one brings the information to a clean and organized format.

## What I learned:
- **Bootstrap's Card Layout** for better information presentation and responsive design.
- **SCSS** for more flexible and modular styling.
- **Embedding Google Maps, Google Calendar, and Excel Workbooks** into the site for better interactivity and up-to-date event tracking.

## What I enhanced:
- **Jekyll** (SSG for static site generation), **Bootstrap**, **Font Awesome** for frontend styling and layout.
